	/// The knowledge is expressed in a way that is coded and interpretable by CDS systems using a variety of formats,
	/// affording direct executability, but potentially limited shareability. The knowledge is typically expressed
	/// focusing on a specific delivery method (modality), technology platform, and implementation environment.
	/// Knowledge at this level is typically built and developed by implementers working in specific technology
	/// platforms, for the purpose of implementation at a specific site, though affordances such as computable mappings
	/// and configuration capabilities can broaden the usability of the knowledge artifact.
	case executable
	
	/// The knowledge is expressed as narrative text, affording broad shareability, but limited computability. The
	/// knowledge is typically expressed independent of delivery method (modality), technology platform, and
	/// implementation site. Knowledge at this level is typically authored by guideline developers for a broad range of
	/// purposes including communication of policy, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination of best-practices.
	case narrative
	
	/// The knowledge is expressed as organized text, often accompanied by diagrams such as flow charts and decision
	/// tables, affording broad shareability and moderate computability. The knowledge is typically expressed
	/// independent of delivery method (modality), technology platform, and implementation site. Knowledge at this level
	/// is typically authored by clinical domain experts for the purpose of communication the description of
	/// recommendations for implementation in various modalities.
	case semiStructured = "semi-structured"
	
	/// The knowledge is expressed in a structured way that is interpretable by computer, including being coded using
	/// standard terminologies and specifications for the representation of structured content, affording broad
	/// shareability and high computability. The knowledge is typically expressed independent of delivery method
	/// (modality), technology platform, and implementation site. Knowledge at this level is typically authored by
	/// knowledge engineersto enable precise communication and validation of the recommendations.
