	/// Observations that measure or record any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall
	/// health and wellness.  Not under direct supervision of practitioner such as a physical therapist. (e.g., laps
	/// swum, steps, sleep data)
	case activity
	
	/// Observations generated by physical exam findings including direct observations made by a clinician and use of
	/// simple instruments and the result of simple maneuvers performed directly on the patient's body.
	case exam
	
	/// Observations generated by imaging. The scope includes observations regarding plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI,
	/// angiography, echocardiography, and nuclear medicine.
	case imaging
	
	/// The results of observations generated by laboratories.  Laboratory results are typically generated by
	/// laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology,
	/// anatomic pathology (including digital pathology), microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on
	/// analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
	case laboratory
	
	/// Observations generated by other procedures.  This category includes observations resulting from interventional
	/// and non-interventional procedures excluding laboratory and imaging (e.g., cardiology catheterization, endoscopy,
	/// electrodiagnostics, etc.).  Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular
	/// information about component observations made during a procedure.  An example would be when a gastroenterologist
	/// reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
	case procedure
	
	/// Social History Observations define the patient's occupational, personal (e.g., lifestyle), social, familial, and
	/// environmental history and health risk factors that may impact the patient's health.
	case socialHistory = "social-history"
	
	/// Assessment tool/survey instrument observations (e.g., Apgar Scores, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)).
	case survey
	
	/// Observations generated by non-interventional treatment protocols (e.g. occupational, physical, radiation,
	/// nutritional and medication therapy)
	case therapy
	
	///  Clinical observations measure the body's basic functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
	/// height, weight, body mass index, head circumference, pulse oximetry, temperature, and body surface area.
