	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to obtain and open a record entry for inspection or review.
	case access
	
	/// Occurs when an agent makes any change to record entry content currently residing in storage considered permanent
	/// (persistent).
	case amend
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to create and move archive artifacts containing record entry content,
	/// typically to long-term offline storage.
	case archive
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to capture the agent’s digital signature (or equivalent indication)
	/// during formal validation of record entry content.
	case attest
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to decode record entry content from a cipher.
	case decrypt
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to scrub record entry content to reduce the association between a set of
	/// identifying data and the data subject in a way that might or might not be reversible.
	case deidentify
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to tag record entry(ies) as obsolete, erroneous or untrustworthy, to warn
	/// against its future use.
	case deprecate
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to permanently erase record entry content from the system.
	case destroy
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to release, transfer, provision access to, or otherwise divulge record
	/// entry content.
	case disclose
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to encode record entry content in a cipher.
	case encrypt
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to selectively pull out a subset of record entry content, based on
	/// explicit criteria.
	case extract
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to tag or otherwise indicate special access management and suspension of
	/// record entry deletion/destruction, if deemed relevant to a lawsuit or which are reasonably anticipated to be
	/// relevant or to fulfill organizational policy under the legal doctrine of “duty to preserve”.
	case hold
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to connect related record entries.
	case link
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to combine or join content from two or more record entries, resulting in
	/// a single logical record entry.
	case merge
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to: a) initiate capture of potential record content, and b) incorporate
	/// that content into the storage considered a permanent part of the health record.
	case originate
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to remove record entry content to reduce the association between a set of
	/// identifying data and the data subject in a way that may be reversible.
	case pseudonymize
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to recreate or restore full status to record entries previously deleted
	/// or deprecated.
	case reactivate
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to a) initiate capture of data content from elsewhere, and b) incorporate
	/// that content into the storage considered a permanent part of the health record.
	case receive
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to restore information to data that allows identification of information
	/// source and/or information subject.
	case reidentify
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to produce and deliver record entry content in a particular form and
	/// manner.
	case report
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to recreate record entries and their content from a previous created
	/// archive artefact.
	case restore
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to change the form, language or code system used to represent record
	/// entry content.
	case transform
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to send record entry content from one (EHR/PHR/other) system to another.
	case transmit
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to remove a tag or other cues for special access management had required
	/// to fulfill organizational policy under the legal doctrine of “duty to preserve”.
	case unhold
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to disconnect two or more record entries previously connected, rendering
	/// them separate (disconnected) again.
	case unlink
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to reverse a previous record entry merge operation, rendering them
	/// separate again.
	case unmerge
	
	/// Occurs when an agent causes the system to confirm compliance of data or data objects with regulations,
	/// requirements, specifications, or other imposed conditions based on organizational policy.
